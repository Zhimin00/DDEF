We propose DDEF, a deep fusion framework for multimodal decision-making. DDEF is accurate, efficient, reliable, scalable and very simple in design.

Codes:
'utils.py' defined some shows details of Experiment 1.

'train.py' shows details of Experiment 1 on MNIST-SVHN.

This work is proposed for Dual-Level Deep Evidential Fusion: Integrating Multimodal Information for Enhanced Reliable Decision-Making in Deep Learning.
